Title: Effects of COVID-19 On The Indian Economy, And On The Indian Stock Markets

Author: Arindam Chatterjee

Abstract
The global outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic has stopped many economic activities and no cure has been found to date to fight with Corona-Virus. It has produced a severe economic impact on the Indian Economy. The world is poised to get into a recession in F.Y.2020-â€™21. The Indian Economy was already in a gloomy state before Covid-19 struck. With the prolonged country-wide lockdown, global economic downturn, and associated disruption of demand and supply chains, the economy is likely to face a protracted period of slowdown and is likely to be in recession for some time to come. In this paper, I have assessed the potential impact of the shock on various segments of the economy and have analyzed the policies that have been announced so far by the Indian Govt. and the Reserve Bank of India to absorb the economic shock and put forward a set of policy recommendations for specific sectors.
